Athletes are often advised to consume water  until their urine is clear. This is good advice; however, it takes  time for the kidneys to process body fluids and store it in the  bladder. Another way of looking at this is that the quality of the  urine produced is an average over the time it takes to make that  urine.

Hypertension  Chronic high blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is a  significant health hazard affecting one out of three adults in the  United States.3 This chronic condition is a major cause of heart  attacks and strokes, yet it has no symptoms until blood pressure  reaches very high levels, which is why it is known as “the silent  killer.” The only way to find out if you have high blood pressure is to  get an accurate reading of your resting blood pressure rate, which  is best done by a medical professional and should be monitored  regularly.  High blood pressure is such an important factor in cardiovascular  disease, that keeping it within a healthy range is vitally important.  Blood pressure readings consist of two numbers. The top number  measures systolic pressure (when the heart contracts) and the  bottom number measures diastolic pressure (when the heart is at  rest). The key blood pressure numbers to keep in mind are:  • Ideal. 120 over 80 or below  • Prehypertension. Higher than 120 over 80 and lower than 139  over 89  • Hypertension.

For carbohydrates, the AMDR is 45 to 65 percent of daily calories  (which is a recommended daily allowance of 158–228 grams for  1,400–1,600 daily calories). Carbohydrates that are high in fiber  should make up the bulk of intake. The AMDR for protein is 10 to 30  percent of daily calories (35–105 grams for 1,400 daily calories for  girls and 40–120 grams for 1,600 daily calories for boys). The AMDR  for fat is 25 to 35 percent of daily calories (39–54 grams for 1,400  daily calories for girls and 44–62 grams for 1,600 daily calories for  boys), depending on caloric intake and activity level.

The  early period of this stage is very different from the end. For example,  during the early years of middle age, many women experience  pregnancy, childbirth, and lactation. In the latter part of this life  stage, women face perimenopause, which is a transition period that  leads up to menopause, or the end of menstruation. A number of  physical changes take place in the middle-aged years, including the  loss of bone mass in women due to dropping levels of estrogen  during menopause. In both men and women, visual acuity declines,  and by age forty there can be a decreased ability to see objects  at a close distance, a condition known as presbyopia.1 All of these  are signs of aging, as the human body begins to change in subtle  and not-so-subtle ways. However, a middle aged person can remain  vital, healthy, and near his or her physical peak with proper diet and  adequate exercise.  During this stage of the human life cycle, adults begin to  experience the first outward signs of aging. Wrinkles begin to  appear, joints ache after a highly active day, and body fat  accumulates. There is also a loss of muscle tone and elasticity in  the connective tissue.2 Many people in their late thirties and in  1.',\n",

The first step in  constructing a protein is the transcription (copying) of the genetic  information in double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into  the single-stranded, messenger macromolecule ribonucleic acid  (RNA). RNA is chemically similar to DNA, but has two differences;  one is that its backbone uses the sugar ribose and not deoxyribose;  and two, it contains the nucleotide base uracil, and not thymidine.  The RNA that is transcribed from a given piece of DNA contains the  same information as that DNA, but it is now in a form that can be  read by the cellular protein manufacturer known as the ribosome.  Next, the RNA instructs the cells to gather all the necessary amino  acids and add them to the growing protein chain in a very specific  order. This process is referred to as translation. The decoding of  genetic information to synthesize a protein is the central foundation  of modern biology.  Figure 6.4 Steps for Building a Protein  368  |  Defining Protein',\n",
